# Urban Heat Island (UHI) : Study and Analysis for the National Capital Territory of Delhi
This repository contains the code and resources for studying and analyzing the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. The project aims to automate the process of extracting, processing, and visualizing satellite data to understand the correlation between urbanization, vegetation cover, and temperature variations over time.
# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Delhi using Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellite data. The analysis includes calculating Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Emissivity,Radiance, and Brightness temperature, along with performing a time series analysis of Thermal Infrared (TIR) imagery. The project is designed with the idea of automating the entire process of calculating LST and UHI.
# Key Features
**Data Extraction:** Extracted Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 data (Bands 4, 5, and 10) for the NCT of Delhi from Earth Explorer using API.

**Data Processing:** Automated the calculation and visualization of the following parameters:
- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
- Emissivity
- Radiance
- Brightness Temperature
- Land Surface Temperature (LST)
- Urban Heat Island (UHI)

# Technologies Used
**Python:** For data extraction, processing, and analysis.

**Google Colab:** For cloud-based data processing and visualization.

**Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Data:** Utilized satellite data to analyze surface temperature and vegetation.

# Results
The results of this analysis highlight the impact of urbanization and vegetation cover on the UHI effect in the NCT of Delhi. The comparison of UHI zones with LULC changes provides insights into how urban growth influences temperature variations.
